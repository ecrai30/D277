# üëã Hello developer!
This project contains a basic HTML structure to get you started. Check our [tutorials for frontend development](https://www.w3schools.com/where_to_start.asp) to learn the basics of [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) and [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp). ü¶Ñ This project not only demonstrates my technical skills in frontend development but also highlights myability to enhance user engagement through interactive elements. The inclusion of a user information form with JavaScript validation showcases my commitment to creating dynamic and user-friendly web applications. These experiences contribute to my proficiency as a Front-End Developer, ensuring that the websites I develop not only look visually appealing but also provide a seamless and secure user experience.


## üèó What's next?


Use these four files as your starting point:

- **README.md:** This is the file that you are reading now. You can change the text in this file to leave information to others about your website - or delete it.
- **index.html:** This is the default page for your space, where you write HTML, the standard markup language for creating web pages.
- **styles.css:** Use the CSS file to style your content and change the look of your space with beautiful colors, fonts and much more. 
- **scripts.js:** Use this file to make your website dynamic and interactive with JavaScript.
